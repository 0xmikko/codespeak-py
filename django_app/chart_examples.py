CHART_ANALYSIS_EXAMPLES = [
    {
        "visual_description": "A classic ascending triangle pattern with what appears to be a majestic bull charging upward through resistance levels.",
        "pattern_analysis": "Bull Flag formation with a hint of 'Charging Rhino' pattern - very bullish indeed!",
        "humorous_prediction": "According to the ancient art of Chart-Fu, this bull is so determined it might just break through your screen. Expect prices to moon harder than a space monkey with rocket boots!",
        "technical_explanation": "The RSI is showing clear signs of 'FOMO fever' while the MACD lines are doing the tango. The 50-day moving average has formed what technical analysts call 'The Stairway to Heaven' pattern. My crystal ball (which I definitely use for serious analysis) suggests this stock will either go up, down, or sideways. You're welcome."
    },
    {
        "visual_description": "A descending wedge that resembles a sleeping dragon curled up, waiting to wake up and breathe fire on short sellers.",
        "pattern_analysis": "The legendary 'Slumbering Dragon' formation - extremely rare and 87.3% accurate according to my completely made-up statistics.",
        "humorous_prediction": "This dragon has been hibernating longer than my motivation on Monday mornings. When it wakes up, it'll either roar to the moon or roll over and go back to sleep. Either way, it's going to be epic!",
        "technical_explanation": "The Fibonacci retracements have aligned with the constellation of Ursa Major, creating what ancient traders called 'The Perfect Storm of Maybe.' The volume profile suggests that either everyone is buying or everyone is selling - or possibly both. The Bollinger Bands are tighter than my jeans after Thanksgiving dinner."
    },
    {
        "visual_description": "A head and shoulders pattern that looks remarkably like Elvis Presley giving a sideways glance to the market.",
        "pattern_analysis": "The 'Elvis Pattern' - when the King appears on your chart, you know something big is about to happen. Thank you, thank you very much.",
        "humorous_prediction": "Elvis has entered the building (aka your portfolio). This pattern suggests the price will shake, rattle, and roll its way to new heights. Or it might just leave the building. The King works in mysterious ways.",
        "technical_explanation": "The left shoulder shows clear accumulation by what I can only assume are blue suede shoe manufacturers. The head indicates maximum confusion among traders who can't tell if this is a top or if they're all shook up. The right shoulder suggests everyone is still waiting for the real Elvis to appear."
    },
    {
        "visual_description": "A symmetrical triangle that has the uncanny appearance of a pizza slice, making me both hungry and bullish.",
        "pattern_analysis": "The 'Pepperoni Special' triangle - when food patterns appear on charts, the market is clearly trying to tell us something about our lunch choices.",
        "humorous_prediction": "This pizza slice suggests the market is ready to deliver gains in 30 minutes or less, or your money back! The extra cheese layer (support level) indicates strong fundamentals, while the crust (resistance) looks crispy and ready to break.",
        "technical_explanation": "The toppings distribution (price action) shows optimal coverage across all time frames. The cheese-to-sauce ratio is perfectly balanced, indicating healthy market sentiment. Technical analysts who studied at the Pizza University would call this a 'deliciously bullish' formation."
    },
    {
        "visual_description": "A double bottom formation that looks like a camel with two humps viewed from an unfortunate angle.",
        "pattern_analysis": "The 'Confused Camel' pattern - when desert animals appear on your charts, it usually means you've been staring at screens too long without water breaks.",
        "humorous_prediction": "This camel has been wandering through the desert of bear markets and is finally seeing an oasis of profits ahead. Or it might just be another mirage. Either way, pack sunscreen for this journey to potential gains!",
        "technical_explanation": "The twin humps indicate strong support at these levels, much like how camels store water for long journeys. The MACD is showing 'hump day' momentum, while the stochastic oscillator is as confused as a camel in a snowstorm."
    },
    {
        "visual_description": "A cup and handle pattern that resembles a coffee mug left by a very caffeinated day trader.",
        "pattern_analysis": "The 'Espresso Shot' formation - when coffee appears on charts, it means the market is waking up from its afternoon slump.",
        "humorous_prediction": "This coffee cup is so perfectly formed, it's making me jittery just looking at it. Expect prices to get as hyped as a trader on their 6th espresso shot. Warning: may cause rapid price movements and uncontrollable optimism.",
        "technical_explanation": "The cup formation shows accumulation by institutional coffee drinkers, while the handle indicates retail investors are still trying to figure out which end is up. The breakout volume should be higher than a barista's energy level during morning rush."
