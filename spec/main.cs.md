# Financial horoscope
Let's build a service to detect market patters - "Financial horoscope". Use django and other python library you need. 

## User flow
User can upload a graph in PNG / JPEG format, then backend analyses it and write an explanation in format of technical analysys. Something like "I can see a lion figure on the graph, so...". User chatGPT and other AI-related agent libraries when needed to create a creative repsonses with graph. The best result - a graph with fun tech analysis and comments with great sens of humour. 

I understand that probably, the system should have some great examples - to make mutliple-shot training, make a python file with list of examples, I can fill it manually.

// Feel free to un-comment the example spec below to try CodeSpeak in action:
